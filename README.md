# 💳 ATM Simulation System (Python)

A simple command-line ATM system built with Python that allows users to securely create accounts, log in, deposit/withdraw funds, view balance, and track transaction history — with data saved locally in a JSON file. Designed for beginners and freshers to demonstrate skills in file handling, OOP, JSON, and CLI design.
